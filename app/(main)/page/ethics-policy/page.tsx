                        <h1>ExploreWiseTips.com Editorial Policy</h1>

                        <p>At ExploreWiseTips.com, we uphold the highest standards of professionalism and integrity in our reporting. Our commitment is to provide accurate, fair, and unbiased coverage of the industries we explore, including film, television, video games, and more.</p>

                        <h2>Our Ethical Guidelines</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We do not publish personal attacks against individuals, companies, or colleagues. We prioritize objectivity and respect in all our reporting, especially on sensitive topics.</li>
                            <li>We adhere to Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines for transparency. This includes disclosing the platform on which a video game review was played and whether a copy was provided. We also consider regional or platform-specific factors in our reporting.</li>
                            <li>Disclaimers and disclosures are prominently displayed to ensure clarity for our readers.</li>
                            <li>Reviewers are always kept separate from those who preview or conduct interviews. This ensures that our editorial and criticism remain objective and independent from studio relationships.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Giving Credit and Obtaining Permissions</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Unless directly from an official source, we provide link credit to original sources for news and assets. We believe in supporting the online publishing ecosystem and following best journalism practices.</li>
                            <li>For images and non-official art, we credit the artist and seek permission for their use whenever possible.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Spoiler Policy</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We respect embargoes and do not include spoilers in previews or reviews without permission. When spoilers are included, we avoid revealing them in headlines or images, ensuring readers can choose whether to engage with such content.</li>
                            <li>To protect our readers&apos; experience, we always include a spoiler warning at the beginning of articles containing spoilers, particularly during the release window of a piece of entertainment.</li>
                        </ul>
